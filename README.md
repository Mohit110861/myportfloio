# Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a **personal portfolio website** designed and developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in a clean, responsive, and professional format. It acts as a central hub where visitors (such as recruiters, clients, or collaborators) can learn more about me, view my work, and get in touch.

The portfolio emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and user experience, with modern design elements and interactive features powered by JavaScript.

## Why This Project?

A personal portfolio is an essential tool for showcasing not only my technical skills but also my attention to detail, design sense, and creativity.  
By building it with only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I demonstrated my capability to create a complete, attractive, and user-friendly website without relying on frameworks or libraries.

It also provides a platform to continuously update and improve as I grow my skillset and work on more projects.
